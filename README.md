## Cocktail-API-Project (Red Swan Cocktails)

This is a fictional project about cocktails. It works with the API from thecocktaildb.com.



## Motivation

The main motivation behind this project was to get used to the work with API's and the MVC Architecture. I wanted to 
challenge myself with this project. It was a great experience for me in design and development. I spent 1 full month on 
planning, designing, developing and fixing this whole project. I've learnt a ton and understood even more.

## How To Use ?

01) Start the App by clicking on "Get Started"
02) After the app has loaded you can choose between 4 navigation items
03) Search a cocktail or ingredient by clicking on SEARCH 
04) If you have requested an ingredient the result will be a description about the ingredient (with a Read More ... function written in jQuery)
05) You've got also the chance to click "Related Drinks" in order to recieve cocktails which include this ingredient
06) If you have requested a cocktail you'll recieve a thumbnail and the name of the cocktail
07) By clicking on the name you'll be directed to the details of the cocktail where you can find the ingredients and directions to make you own
08) When it's a favorite cocktail of yours you are able to store this one into the favorites list by clicking the heart-icon on the thumbnail (WATCH OUT FOR THE SHAKE-EFFECT!)
09) Like the ingredient search you can also get related drinks who share one ingredient with the actual cocktail (I've written an algorithm which picks a random ingredient out of the ingredients list and makes an own API request)
10) You can look up all your favorite drinks by clicking FAVORITES 
11) You've got the chance to view the details of each one by hitting the name and delete it manually by hitting the "X"
12) When you find a cocktail which is already your favorite you'll see the "liked heart" inside the details, if you want to delete it out of your favorites again you can click the heart and it will be transformed into the "unliked heart" again
13) By clicking SURPRISE you can surprise yourself with a random cocktail which is choosen out of the whole database (> 500 drinks)
14) You can see the details of it by clicking on the name again

HAVE FUN!
